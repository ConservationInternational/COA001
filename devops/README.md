## COA001

* PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS REPO'S GITHUB CLONE FOLDER, as the Vagrantfile here is different from the one this special box uses.
* DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPTS LIKE SO `sh davecmds.sh`, run them individually

Download the base box from dropbox, this box has a preconfigured env (Vagrantfile, private key, loaded postGRES DB) into COA001DB (400MB size)
https://www.dropbox.com/s/batwigad7b6uucx/COA001.box

### MAIN INSTRUCTIONS
* If this not your first time trying this, remove the box and all of itâ€™s contents off of your system, `vagrant destroy -f`, use the virtualbox GUI to double check,
Remove your original COA001DB folder as well

```sh
# Create a new directory called COA001DB, and change into it
$ mkdir COA001DB
$ cd COA001DB

# Download the box file, via wget, or clicking the link, or what have you
$ wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/batwigad7b6uucx/COA001.box

# Add the box to vagrant
$ vagrant box add COA001 path/to/downloaded/box/COA001.box

# Initialize a Vagrantfile and edit line 15:
# 15: config.vm.box = "COA001"
$ vagrant init
$ vi Vagrantfile

# Boot the vagrant box
$ vagrant up

# Now, while the box is booting, it'll eventually start trying to auth with the
# following error:
# ==> default: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
#   default: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:2227
#   default: SSH username: vagrant
#   default: SSH auth method: private key
#   default: Warning: Connection timeout. Retrying...
#   default: Warning: Authentication failure. Retrying...
#   default: Warning: Authentication failure. Retrying...
#   default: Warning: Authentication failure. Retrying...
#
# While this is happening, open a new terminal window and copy the private_key
# file from the COA001 git repository to the
# ./vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/ folder (this is created by Vagrant after
# `vagrant up`)
$ cp path/to/COA001/repository/devops/private_key ./vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/

# Now it should successfully authenticate
```
To config PG Commander

The password for postgres, is `postgres`

Replace TEST with your directory name, like the line below this one.

The private key is in the install directories, `~/COA001DB/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key` folder

Open up, an issue if have any problems.
