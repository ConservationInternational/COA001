#### COASST Back End API

### Setup

After cloning run `sudo npm install` to install necessary node modules

`npm start` will start the server in development mode

### Testing

`npm test` runs all tests

`NODE_ENV=test mocha path/to/file.test.js` to run a specific test file

### Organization

- `devops` - provision of Vagrant boxes, and other fun stuff to get your local environment working
- `src` - Source code
  - `contexts` - Domain specific code.  Where the meat of the project is.  Dependent on the model/db layer.  Inspired by [DCI][0]
  - `db` - Database related files.  We use [Bookshelf][1] as an ORM, which is based on [Knex][2] as a query builder.  Migrations are contained here
  - `models` - Model code.  These are all [Bookshelf][1] models
  - `server` - Server code.  We use [Hapi][3].  Dependent on the contexts.  Code for server configuration, route configuration, API validation, etc.
  - `test` - Test code.  Based on [Mocha][4] and [Chai][5].
